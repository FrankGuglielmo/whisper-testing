 GUEST Hello. Step Men are born here too. Okay, okay. Okay, so I could, I could.
 So we'll test some things. I think the first thing that we could maybe test is... No, I thought... No, no, no. So last one I think was the simulation of an actual session. I don't know if that's what you were trying. Yeah, so I was...
 Yeah, so what I think I'd like to try if that's okay with you is you speak. Yeah. No, you can record. This is this is we want this information. Okay, so essentially what we'll do is we'll have like, so in the next like 10 minutes, we'll have a segment where maybe you just speak for like straight Italian and for the future.
 30 seconds and then speak, you know, straight 30 seconds in English, you could say the same thing. And if you want, if you have trouble finding something to say for 30 seconds, you can just say all of the things that you would say in a meeting like, okay, today we're going to do this and I want to, and you could just lay that out for 30 seconds and then you could just repeat that same thing in English. And so we'll see how that, how our model picks that up. And then I will also try and say,
 a little bit of Italian, a little bit of English, then we'll have a section where we're both quiet for a little bit, for like maybe 30 seconds or a minute to test that. But I think we can do that all in the next 10 minutes. So if you'd like to begin, you know, maybe just say for the next 30 seconds, speak something in Italian and only Italian.
 Yeah, or anything you would like that you can speak about for 30 seconds in Italian. Sure. Yeah. No, this is perfect. We can do it in this one.
 Okay.
 Okay, perfect. That's great. I think I understood a bit of that. We're going to do some of the sentences that we did. This is the second session. Thank you for meeting with me today. Thank you for meeting with me as well. Okay, so perfect.
 I think that's good. And so let's try something if you're able to, if you're okay with it. Let's repeat that same kind of agenda, but halfway through. Let's maybe do like 15 seconds where you're speaking that same script in Italian. And then at the 15 second mark, let's move to you speaking English, if that's something that you're okay with.
 Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad. Yn ymwneud yw'r llwyddiad, yw'r llwyddiad.
 Perfecto. Grazie. Okay. That's amazing. And then so I think I'm just going to talk and so I think that can kind of like kill two kind of birds with one stone because we also want to test when it's super silent. So I think I'll speak for the next, say, minute or two. I'll do a little bit just English a little bit just the town.
 and then I'll combine both. That'll take around a minute or two. And in that time, we'll also test silence on your end. So since you'll be listening to me, your audio will be silent for the next two minutes. And then we can test that. I am going to pull up a little script that I have prepared. Let's see, so if I go to this, and meaning notes, scripts. Okay, so the first.
 script, we'll be doing English. This is one that I was testing. Hello, my name is Frank Llema. I'm a fourth year computer science major at the University of San Francisco. I am here both as a software developer and a language learner testing this model to see how well it performs with a variety of different scripts. I would really like to use this platform to get better at Italian and I'm excited to see what we can do. Okay, that was the English one. I will do the Italian one right now and then hopefully
 We will see what the transcription is. I'm excited to see what this model produces. Yes. Yeah, that could work. I think, yeah. Right, we can try that. I actually spoke for, yeah, there was a little bit of noise. Right. So I think it's.
 I think so we we gotten some some data with both mics being on even though there was a little bit of muffled audio on your end I think that will be totally fine for the model sake, but we can also try it with you actually muting it as well to see if that changes Again at the end of the day we want to Yeah, so we have enough information with both mics on so if you'd like you can turn you can turn your mic off And we'll see that's actually a really good point I hadn't thought about but we'll see because some some you
 users or some students may only turn their mic on when they want to talk. So we can simulate that as well. So if you want to mute your mic right now, and then I'll speak for like a minute or two, we'll collect some data and that should be perfect. Okay, Bravo, Grazie. Okay, so I will speak this next bit all in Italian. Yeah, mi chiamo Franco Yelmo e frecuento il quarto di Emponematica Preso L'Università.

 Okay. Okay. In this script, I will be combining English and Italian to test if whisper can detect the change and transcribe despite a shift in the language. I will start by telling you about a time when I was in Italy that made me realize how convenient it is to order breakfast in Italy. Not only is the
 quality, not only is the quality very good but the price is very favorable to the customer.
 Que negli Stati Uniti mi costerebbe almeno 10 doleri. Anche il cibo e cosi fresco e mi piacere. OK. So I know not all of that was perfect Italian. But it should be good enough. And I know some students who will be using this don't have perfect Italian. So OK. Yes, I can hear you. Yes.
 You're good. Yeah, that would be a good thing to test. We can see that.
 Yeah, okay. Yeah, I will read just the English and Italian. Yeah. Okay, I will read that. But yeah, that's also something we can test as well. Okay, so I'll just try it this time. Okay. In this script, I will be combining English and Italian to test if whisper can detect the change and transcribe despite the shift in the language. I will start by telling you about a time when I was
 in Italy that made me realize how convenient it is to order breakfast in Italy. Not only is the quality very good, but the price is very favorable to the consumer. Quando vado al bar adoro comprore un cappuccino e un cornetto cioccolato. Non capisco perché sia molto più economico nare il cibo in Italia che in America. Consoli tra i liu e lo posso ottenere così tanto, tener gli stagioni.
 I think that's good. Some of the pronunciation could have been off, of course. But yeah, I think we have some great, you know what, what I'll do is I will be silent for the next just say minute and we'll see. But other than that, I think we'll have all the all the data that we want to get.
 from at least this first session. Okay. Okay, perfect. We, yeah, we can say silent for about 30 seconds. I'll give a chat, I'll give a thumbs up and then we can just sign off. Perfect.

 Hello. Now, have you been here too? Okay, okay. Yes, okay. So I could, I could.
